# Enclosure

![Enclosusre Render](../Images/enclosure-render.png)

sdvx_acrylic.svg contains the acrylic laser cut designs for the Note. Each layer is labeled with its location in the stack and thickness. The enclosure uses eight slices of acrylic in total: four 6 mm slices and four 3mm slices.

## Workflow

The primary design was done in Inkscape. However, Inkscape isn't very good at placement of multiple slices onto a sheet and .dxf export. I used Adobe Illustrator and AutoCAD to generate the final production files.

## TODO

Upload production .dxf files
